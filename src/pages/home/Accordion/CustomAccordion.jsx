        <AccordionBody>
          When buying a property for investment, consider factors like the
          location's growth potential, property price trends, and the
          surrounding amenities. Research the neighborhood's safety, proximity
          to schools, transportation options, and future developments. Make sure
          the property aligns with your long-term goals, whether you're looking
          for rental income, resale value, or personal use.

          How can I evaluate if a property is a good investment opportunity in
          the long run?
        </AccordionHeader>
        <AccordionBody>
          To evaluate a property's investment potential, look at its past price
          history, future market trends, and rental demand. Research the areaâ€™s
          development plans and infrastructure projects that may increase the
          property's value. Additionally, consider the property's condition,
          age, and maintenance costs. Work with experts like real estate agents
          and financial advisors to get accurate insights on whether the
          investment aligns with your portfolio goals.
